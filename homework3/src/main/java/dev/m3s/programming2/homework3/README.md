# Homework 3

- Java files for homework 3 should be placed in this folder.
- The following line should be added to all Java files as the first line:

- Tags names should comply with the required format, i.e., homework3_vY_CustomPart, and Y is the version number you have implemented (1 or 2).
  - The custom part can be chosen freely. However, incremental numbers 1,2,3, etc., are recommended.
